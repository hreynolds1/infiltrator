            <h1>What's the game?</h1>
            <p>Infiltrator is a two player turn based strategy game based on military fights. To be perfectly honest, this was kind of a last minute idea, so the game is fairly simple.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="objective" class="textdisplay">
            <h1>The objective</h1>
            <p>Your mission, should you accept it, is to wipe out the enemy barracks, while defending your own. You'll need to carefully plan your moves, and anticipate your opponent's moves.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="howtoplaytext" class="textdisplay">
            <h1>How to play</h1>
            <p>You start the game off with a military barracks and 10 soldiers each. You can move 3 soldiers a turn, and each soldier can move up to 5 tiles. Soldiers look like the guy on the right, but coloured red or blue. At the end of your turn, up to 5 of your soldiers can either shoot or build a wall. Soldiers take 3 shots to kill. You can tell their health by how "filled up" their colour goes. Click the soldier to show this.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="howtowin" class="textdisplay">
            <h1>How to not suck</h1>
            <p>There is no way to undo your moves, so <span class="bold">think your moves through before you do them.</span> Try to think from the other player's perspective, and think of what they might do to counter you ahead of time. Other than that, just uh get good lol</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hazards" class="textdisplay">
            <h1>Hazards</h1>
            <p>There are, of course, some work hazards involved in operating a small army force. At the start of each round, the game will automatically generate some rocks and walls for cover, as well as a couple landmines. If your troop steps on a landmine, it will explode, dealing 1 damage to them and stunning them for the rest of the turn.</p>
